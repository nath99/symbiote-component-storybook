# Components

Components are reusable parts of the user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications.

Individual components can be used in multiple different patterns and contexts. For example, the Card component can be used to display a promotion, or provide a call to action for the user to click through. The goal in mind is that components are kept consistant in terms of style and interactivity throughout your website.

Each component has a set of rules that determine how and when it should be used.
