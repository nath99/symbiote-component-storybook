# Symbiote Design System

Welcome to The Symbiote Design System Use this design system to provide a human centered, consistent and trustworthy online experience for everyone who accesses your website. It's a living, breathing, pull-request loving, store of how we, as an organisation wish to help you craft your web experiences.

Our Design System aims to be an extremely flexible and modifiable toolkit. It offers a flat file structure to help you easily curate it to best serve your needs. Whether you're a designer or developer or maybe even both, the documenation throughout aims to help you quickly get started. We have documented all aspects of our components and have provided realistic examples and snippets to get you up and running quickly.

It's released under an MIT license, apart from the use of our logo, it's free and open software. [Get started here](?path=/story/design-system-getting-started--page). If you find this design system useful, we'd love to hear about it at [hello@symbiote.com.au](mailto:hello@symbiote.com.au?subject=Symbiote%20Human%20Centred%20Design%20System&body=Hi%20Symbiote,).
