# Toggle

Dark mode (Put example here)

The Toggle component act as on/off switches. They prompt users to choose between two mutually exclusive options and always have a default value. Toggles should provide immediate results, giving users the freedom to control their preferences as needed.

### When to use this component

Toggle switches are best used for changing the state of system functionalities and preferences. Toggles may replace two radio buttons or a single checkbox to allow users to choose between two opposing states.

### When not to use this component

Do not use the Toggle component when the setting being toggled is ambiguous or has a level of complexity. Toggles should only be used for very simple and straight forward settings or decisions.
