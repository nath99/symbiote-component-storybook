This component is used to notify the user when a something has occured, for example, when a new feature has been made available or if an error has occured.

### When to use this component

Use this component sparingly and only when a small piece of text will be enough to relay that something requires attention.

### When not to use this component

If the event that has occured requires more text than a single word consider using a Notification or Page Alert component instead.
