# Getting started

Getting started is easy, the Symbiote Design System is hosted on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@symbiotetech/symbiote-component-library). Simply install it as a dependency using either
```jsx
yarn add @symbiotetech/symbiote-component-library
npm install @symbiotetech/symbiote-component-library
```

Once installed all you have to do is import a component from the Symbiote Component Library like so.

```jsx
import { Button } from '@symbiotetech/symbiote-component-library'
```

To use an imported component, simply supply it with the appropriate props.

```jsx
<Button
    type="primary"
    size="md">
    Click me
</Button>
```


The Symbiote Design System is fully open source and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/symbiote/symbiote-component-library). Feel free to fork this project.
