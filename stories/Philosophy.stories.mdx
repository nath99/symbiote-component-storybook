# Philosophy

In creating this design system we thought to apply a human first approach to design. We wanted to deeply empathise with the people who use our products. This design system aims to serve every person regardless of their abilites or disabilites whether these be visual, hearing, neurological, cognitive or a motor function disability. Every person has worth and has a right to access content. We hope that this design system will empower others to have a deep empathy for their users.

We did not leave accessibility planning as the last step in designing this system, instead we incorporated it from the very beginning. For users that use screen readers our components interface and read correctly. For users who navigate using a keyboard all interactive items are available. Our color palette and typography set meets strict WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1 AA values.

Other design systems may often obscure accessability features or do not include them at all. We have aimed to bring our accessability features to the forefront of our designs while at the same time crafting elegant and modern design elements.
